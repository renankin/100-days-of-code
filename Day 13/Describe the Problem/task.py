# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing?
# My answer: It is iterating over 1 to 19.
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"?
# My answer: it will print "You got it" when the value is 20
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i?
# My answer: That it will reach 20, but it will never reach it because the
# range only goes up to 20.
