Advanced Decorators
Create a logging_decorator() which is going to print the name of the function that was called, the arguments it was given and finally the returned output: 
    You called a_function(1,2,3) 
    It returned: 6 
The value 6 is the return value of the function.

Don't change the body of a_function. 

IMPORTANT: You only need to use *args, you can ignore **kwargs in this exercise.
